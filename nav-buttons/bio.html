                     <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a Statistics graduate and a Data science recruit with a good knowledge in data analysis.There are many things I like to do, to see and to experience.
I love spending time on fixing little deatails and also working in a team,you'll learn faster and much more.As they say "team work makes dream work".I like to have meaningful conversations with strangers in a taxi.I like to be surrounded by people from all walks of life.</p> 

<p>I graduated with a bachelor's degree majoring in Statistics.I have experience working in a gaming industry by way of an internship with a company running the national lottery in South Africa,which has helped me develop technical capabilities in Product Management. 
I have consistently proven my ability to meet deadlines and achieve project objectives,solve critical problems and prioritize crucial tasks while maintaining high standards expected of my role.</p>

<p> I'm currently a Data Science recruit at Umuzi Academy where I'm acquiring new set of skills in tech to further my career goals.Feel free to check my porfolio and see what I'm currently busy with.</p>
